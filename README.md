Blank Intel XDK App Designer Project for Cordova
================================================

See [LICENSE.md](<LICENSE.md>) for license terms and conditions.

Use this project as a starting point for an Intel XDK App Designer project for
creating an Apache Cordova hybrid mobile app. One key file (`init-dev.js`)
contains the initialization code needed to handle an Intel XDK device ready, a
Cordova device ready or browser document ready init events in a way that allows
you to run your app in any of these environments.

See the *Blank Cordova Starter* template for more information.
